									<p>I this scenario I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.<br />
									   The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,<br />
									   my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will<br />
									   design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my <br /> 
									   recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.<br /> 
									</p>
									<h3 class="major">Ask Phase</h3>
									<p>What is the problem we are trying to solve?</p>
									<ul>
									<li>How to Maximize the annual membership Cyclistic Bikeshare.</li>
									<li>How does annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic Bikeshare differently.</li>
									</ul>	
									<h3 class="major">Prepare Phase</h3>
									<p>I have collected data from January 2022 to December 2022.There were 12 files for each month.There were 13 variables.After making <br />
										sure all the datatypes present in the files were same they were combined to a single file called year_tripdata for our analysis.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Process Phase</h3>
									<p>There are around 5,66,7717 rows.I was  able to find Null values,duplicate rows,to identify which rows can be filled by us by <br />
										reference from the same file etc.Data Cleaning has been done in this phase .The steps that were taken included removing duplicates,<br />
										removing unknown null values, filling some null values by taking reference to the already given data, splitting columns for better<br />
										understanding, removing outliers, changing to correct data types, removing inconsistent values, checking consistency <br />
										in identifiers as well.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Analyze and Share Phase</h3>
									<p>There are two types of riders casual riders and members. Members take more rides than casual members.The rideable type of<br />
									 bikes are Classic,Electrical and Docked. Classical Bikes are mostly used by riders followed by electric and last Docked</p>

									  </div><br>								
									<p>More rides are in spring and summer time i.e., from April to September.Less rides in winter that is from November to March.<br />
										Both casual and member riders have similar pattern in the rise and fall of rides over the year.In case of week days members<br />
										have more rides in the middle of the week and casual riders its weekend.</p>
									
										<div class="image">
											<img src="images/bcs04.jpg" alt="" />
										  </div>

										  <p>Casual members trend to have loner rides than members.Even though more rides are taken by members.Average ride length<br />
											trends to stay near to same for members and for casual riders there is variation.</p>
											<div class="image">
												<img src="images/bcs05.jpg" alt="" />
											  </div>
											  <p>Stations with most number of rides. Top 5 stations with maximum count for casual rides.</p>
											  <h3 class="major">Act Phase</h3>
									<p>Key Findings</p>
											<ul>
											<li>Casual riders take more rides on the weekend and members on the week days.</li>
											<li>Both of them have high number of rides during spring and summer and less on winter.</li>
											<li>Casual riders go for longer trips and members mostly shorter ones.</li>
											<li>Average ride length for members remains aproximately same.</li>
											<li>classic bikes are more used, then electric and then dockedbikes.</li>
										</ul>
									<p>Recommendations:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Marketing campaigns for annual plans with discounts for casual members for spring and summer time should be done one<br />
											 month before it starts.</li>
										<li>Special offers for weekends for casual members can be introduced. One to two rides can be given free,can introduce<br />
											 punching cards etc.</li>
										<li>We can even target stations with most casual riders and give discounts as well</li>
										
									</ul>
