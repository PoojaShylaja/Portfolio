									<p>Here, as a business intelligence analyst by Adventure Works,a fictional global manufacturing companythat produces cycling equipment<br />
										AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due<br />
									    to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share<br />
									    and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate<br />
										“Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team <br />
										to provide them with these insights.</p>
                                                                         
									<h3 class="major">Task</h3>
									<p>To analyze AtliQ Grands’ performance over the past 3 months, identifying revenue trends and key factors. The goal is to provide <br />
										actionable insights for revenue management decisions so that it can regain its market share and revenue.</p>
										
									<h3 class="major">Data</h3>
									<p>The dataset, from codebasics.io, consists of five CSV files. CSV files:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>dim_date</li>
										<li>dim_hotels</li>
										<li>dim_rooms</li>
										<li>fact_aggregated_bookings</li>
										<li>fact_bookings</li>
									</ul>
									<h3 class="major">Data Model</h3>
									<div class="image">
										<img src="images/ha_1.jpg" alt="" />
									  </div>
									  <br>
									  
									<h3 class="major">Key Measures</h3>
									 
									<p><b> ADR : </b> Average Daily rate It is the ratio of revenue to the total rooms booked/sold.It is the measure of the average paid for rooms<br />
									  sold in a given time period
									</p>
									<p><b> Realisation % : </b> It is nothing but the succesful "checked out" percentage over all bookings happened.
							        </p>
									<p><b> RevPAR % : </b> Revenue Per Available Room RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they <br />
										are occupied. RevPAR helps hotels measure their revenue generating performance to accurately price rooms. RevPAR can help hotels  <br />
										measure themselves against other properties or brands.
									</p>		
									<p><b> DBRN : </b> Daily Booked Room Nights This metrics tells on average how many rooms are booked for a day considering a time period
							        </p>
									</p>		
									<p><b> DSRN  : </b> Daily Sellable Room Nights This metrics tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day <br />
										considering a time period</p>	
									<p><b> DURN   : </b> Daily Utilized Room Nights This metric tells on average how many rooms are succesfully utilized by customers for a day <br />
										considering a time period
									</p>
									<p><b>Week-on-Week (WoW)</b> is a type of business metric that measures changes in a specific variable over a period of one week compared <br />
										to the previous week. It is a common way of tracking business performance over time and is particularly useful for analyzing trends <br />
										and identifying areas where improvements can be made.
									</p>
									<p>Here are the metrics for which, the WoW change% is created:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Revenue WoW change % :</b> To get the revenue change percentage week over week.</li>
										<li><b>Occupancy WoW change % :</b> To get the occupancy change percentage week over week.</li>
										<li><b>ADR WoW change % :</b> To get the ADR (Average Daily rate) change percentage week over week.</li>
										<li><b>RevPAR WoW change % :</b> To get the RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) change percentage week over week.</li>
										<li><b>Realisation WoW change % :</b> To get the Realisation change percentage week over week.</li>
										<li><b>DSRN WoW change % :</b> To get the DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights) change percentage week over week.</li>
									</ul>
									<h3 class="major">Dashboard</h3>
									<div class="image">
										<img src="images/hd_2.jpg" alt="" />
									  </div>
									  <br>
									  <p> Dashboard consists of KPIS :Revenue,RevPAR,Avg Ratings,Occupancy,ADR,Realization.</p>

									  <h3 class="major">insights</h3>
									  <ul>
										<li>City that generated most revenue is Mumbai(6660.64M) and Delhi the least(290.92M).</li>
										<li>Even though Delhi generates less revenue one of the properties Atliq Palace comes fourth <br />
											 in total revenue generation.</li>
										<li>Regarding rating Delhi has the highest.</li>
										<li>Amoung Category Luxury created more revenue.</li>
										<li>Weekend occupancy rate is higher compared to weekdays.</li>
										<li>There is only slight schange in Realisation %.</li>
										<li>logtrip,journey,makeyour trip are top booking platforms.</li>
										<li>Revenue generated by Elite and premium together is nearly double the revenue generated<br />
											 by Presidential and standard.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3 class="major">Recommendations</h3>
									  <ul>
										<li>ADR for the rooms ,can be changed to dynamic so that we can have maximum revenue generations.</li>
										<li>Even the Weekend and Weekday Price we can change the pricing, that is for friday and saturday <br />
											we can increase the pricing charged per room.</li>
										<li>Occupancy and ratings of four hotels are below 50 and 3 respectively.There Service need to be<br />
											checked and need to find why they are performing less.</li>
										<li>There offline channels can provide free additional discounts or complimentary night stay etc.</li>
										<li>One of the hotels in delhi is performing really great compared to others in Delhi.So we can do <br />
											an analysis as to what is making it more popular,so that we can implement it on the other<br />
											 hotels as well.</li>
										<li>Ratings should be considered as one the main factors since nowadays no one does anything<br />
											without looking at them.</li>
										</ul>
